Bot Registration Prevention and Email Verification Requirements 1. Problem Statement Your platform is targeted by bot scripts that automatically register accounts using fake emails. Bots generate accounts with common patterns (e.g., username starting with “R” and random numbers). Your system sends email verification to these fake email addresses resulting in many undeliverable emails. This causes email system overload and performance problems. You want to prevent bot registrations and protect system resources. 2. Email Address Verification Before Sending Confirmation Email 2.1 Purpose Verify email validity before sending a confirmation email. Avoid sending emails to fake or invalid addresses. 2.2 Implementation Steps When user registers, first verify if the email address is valid and real. Email verification can include: Syntax checking (basic format validation) Domain verification (check if email domain exists and has mail servers) Use third-party email validation API/services for deep validation (detect disposable emails, role-based emails, etc.) Only after successful email validation, send the email confirmation with verification link. 3. Bot Detection and Blocking 3.1 Detect Bots Based on Registration Patterns Identify suspicious account registration patterns, such as: Usernames with common bot-like format (e.g., starting with “R” + random numbers) Multiple registrations from the same IP address Fast repeated signup attempts Suspicious user agent headers or request timings 3.2 Logging and Recording Suspicious Activity If a registration attempt fails email validation or looks like a bot: Log IP address, timestamp, request headers, and username pattern Store logs securely for auditing and investigation 3.3 Blocking or Rate Limiting Bots Automatically block or temporarily ban IP addresses linked with suspicious activity Implement CAPTCHA (like Google reCAPTCHA) on registration form for suspicious users/IPs Consider progressive rate limiting based on request frequency and behavior
