Google Analytics 4 (GA4) is currently set up but only tracks the homepage. We need to implement Google Tag Manager (GTM) properly and expand tracking coverage across the entire website to capture key user interactions, navigation behavior, and content engagement.

The goal is to have consistent, comprehensive event tracking for marketing, product, and growth analysis.

Scope & Requirements

1. Google Tag Manager Setup
Ensure GTM is correctly implemented and loaded on all pages, including:
Homepage
Blog page
Blog detail pages
Feature pages
Static pages (About Us, etc.)
Confirm GA4 is firing correctly via GTM on every page.
2. Page View Tracking
Track page views for:
Homepage
Blog listing page
Blog detail pages
Feature pages
Other key site pages
3. Header Navigation Tracking
Track click events for main header navigation items, including:
Home
Blog
About Us
Sign In
Get Started
4. Homepage CTA Tracking
Track clicks on homepage buttons:

Get Started

5. Footer Tracking
a. Social Media Subscription Links
Track clicks on social media icons in the footer:

Twitter

LinkedIn
b. Footer Quick Links
Track clicks on footer navigation links:

6. Blog Page Tracking
Track user interactions on the blog page, including:

Clicks on blog category filters
Clicks on individual blog posts

7. Blog Detail Page Tracking
Track engagement on blog article pages:

Any interaction related to navigating or discovering other articles from the detail page
